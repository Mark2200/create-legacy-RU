# Create Legacy
[Create Legacy](https://github.com/Siepert123/create-legacy) is an unofficial port of [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) to [Forge 1.12.2](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html).  
[**Download from CurseForge**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-legacy) or [**Download from Modrinth**](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-legacy)

For those unfamiliar with Create, it is a mod that's all about technology using cogwheels and other kinetic components to create various machines and automate many processes.



## What does this mod feature right now?
At this moment, the mod has covered the basics. There is SU and rotation speed, but no smooth animations. Most assets are taken from original Create directly, but I'm working on replacing the textures to fit in better with 1.12.

It is recommended to install [CTM](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ctm) to enjoy epic connected textures.

Oh, and there is [JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei)/[HEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/had-enough-items) support!



## Why did you make this?
I'm just a 1.12.2 enjoyer, and noticed the demand for a backport of Create was larger than 2 people.



## Things that will defenitely be asked I think
Q: Why use BlockStates instead of the Tile Entity Special Renderer?

A: Using the TESR is complicated and from what I've heard it consumes FPS a lot



Q: why

A: yes
